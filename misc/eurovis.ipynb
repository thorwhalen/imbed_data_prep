While existing lossy compressors offer a high compression ratio with bounded error for regular grid data, methodologies tailored for unstructured mesh data are lacking; for example, one can compress nodal data as 1D arrays, neglecting the spatial coherency of the mesh nodes. Inspired by the SZ compressor, which predicts and quantizes values in a multidimensional array, we dynamically reorganize nodal data into sequences. Each sequence starts with a seed cell; based on a predefined traversal order, the next cell is added to the sequence if the current cell can predict and quantize the nodal data in the next cell with the given error bound. As a result, one can efficiently compress the quantized nodal data in each sequence until all mesh nodes are traversed. This paper also introduces a suite of novel error metrics, namely continuous mean squared error (CMSE) and continuous peak signal-to-noise ratio (CPSNR), to assess compression results for unstructured mesh data. The continuous error metrics are defined by integrating the error function on all cells, providing objective statistics across nonuniformly distributed nodes/cells in the mesh. We evaluate our methods with several scientific simulations ranging from ocean-climate models and computational fluid dynamics simulations with both traditional and continuous error metrics. We demonstrated superior compression ratios and quality than existing lossy compressors.',\n",

Since this research domain centres around users, user evaluation is of extraordinary relevance. Additionally, Immersive Analytics is an interdisciplinary field of research where different communities bring in their own methodologies. It is vital to investigate and synchronise these different approaches with the long-term goal to reach a shared evaluation framework. While there have been several studies focusing on Immersive Analytics as a whole or on certain aspects of the domain, this is the first systematic review of the state of evaluation methodology in Immersive Analytics. The main objective of this systematic literature review is to illustrate methodologies and research areas that are still underrepresented in user studies by identifying current practice in user evaluation in the domain of Immersive Analytics in coherence with the PRISMA protocol.

       " '10.1111/cgf.15077': '##An Experimental Evaluation of Viewpoint-Based 3D Graph Drawing\\n\\nNode-link diagrams are a widely used metaphor for creating visualizations of relational data. Most frequently, such techniques address creating 2D graph drawings, which are easy to use on computer screens and in print. In contrast, 3D node-link graph visualizations are far less used, as they have many known limitations and comparatively few well-understood advantages. A key issue here is that such 3D visualizations require users to select suitable viewpoints. We address this limitation by studying the ability of layout techniques to produce high-quality views of 3D graph drawings. For this, we perform a thorough experimental evaluation, comparing 3D graph drawings, rendered from a covering sampling of all viewpoints, with their 2D counterparts across various state-of-the-art node-link drawing algorithms, graph families, and quality metrics. Our results show that, depending on the graph family, 3D node-link diagrams can contain a many viewpoints that yield 2D visualizations that are of higher quality than those created by directly using 2D node-link diagrams. This not only sheds light on the potential of 3D node-link diagrams but also gives a simple approach to produce high-quality 2D node-link diagrams.',\n",

The changes in Antarctica are also substantially impacting global climate change. Therefore, detailed monitoring of snow evolution is key to understanding such changes. One way to conduct this monitoring is by installing trail cameras in a particular region and then processing the captured information. This option is affordable, but has some drawbacks, such as the fully automatic solution for the extraction of snow height from these images is not feasible. Therefore, it still requires human intervention, manually correcting the inaccurately extracted information. In this paper, we present Antarstick, a tool for visual guidance of the user to potentially wrong values extracted from poor-quality images and support for their interactive correction. This tool allows for much quicker and semi-automated processing of snow height from time-lapse photography.\",\n",
       " '10.1111/cgf.15099': '##AutoVizuA11y: A Tool to Automate Screen Reader Accessibility in Charts\\n\\nCharts remain widely inaccessible on the web for users of assistive technologies like screen readers. This is, in part, due to data visualization experts still lacking the experience, knowledge, and time to consistently implement accessible charts. As a result, screen reader users are prevented from accessing information and are forced to resort to tabular alternatives (if available), limiting the insights that they can gather. We worked with both groups to develop AutoVizuA11y, a tool that automates the addition of accessible features to web-based charts. It generates human-like descriptions of the data using a large language model, calculates statistical insights from the data, and provides keyboard navigation between multiple charts and underlying elements. Fifteen screen reader users interacted with charts made accessible with AutoVizuA11y in a usability test, thirteen of which praised the tool for its intuitive design, short learning curve, and rich information. On average, they took 66 seconds to complete each of the eight analytical tasks presented and achieved a success rate of 89%. Through a SUS questionnaire, the participants gave AutoVizuA11y an \"Excellent\" score — 83.5/100 points. We also gathered feedback from two data visualization experts who used the tool. They praised the tool availability, ease of use and functionalities, and provided feedback to add AutoVizuA11y support for other technologies in the future.'}"

While existing lossy compressors offer a high compression ratio with bounded error for regular grid data, methodologies tailored for unstructured mesh data are lacking; for example, one can compress nodal data as 1D arrays, neglecting the spatial coherency of the mesh nodes. Inspired by the SZ compressor, which predicts and quantizes values in a multidimensional array, we dynamically reorganize nodal data into sequences. Each sequence starts with a seed cell; based on a predefined traversal order, the next cell is added to the sequence if the current cell can predict and quantize the nodal data in the next cell with the given error bound. As a result, one can efficiently compress the quantized nodal data in each sequence until all mesh nodes are traversed. This paper also introduces a suite of novel error metrics, namely continuous mean squared error (CMSE) and continuous peak signal-to-noise ratio (CPSNR), to assess compression results for unstructured mesh data. The continuous error metrics are defined by integrating the error function on all cells, providing objective statistics across nonuniformly distributed nodes/cells in the mesh. We evaluate our methods with several scientific simulations ranging from ocean-climate models and computational fluid dynamics simulations with both traditional and continuous error metrics. We demonstrated superior compression ratios and quality than existing lossy compressors.',\n",

Since this research domain centres around users, user evaluation is of extraordinary relevance. Additionally, Immersive Analytics is an interdisciplinary field of research where different communities bring in their own methodologies. It is vital to investigate and synchronise these different approaches with the long-term goal to reach a shared evaluation framework. While there have been several studies focusing on Immersive Analytics as a whole or on certain aspects of the domain, this is the first systematic review of the state of evaluation methodology in Immersive Analytics. The main objective of this systematic literature review is to illustrate methodologies and research areas that are still underrepresented in user studies by identifying current practice in user evaluation in the domain of Immersive Analytics in coherence with the PRISMA protocol.

       " '10.1111/cgf.15077': '##An Experimental Evaluation of Viewpoint-Based 3D Graph Drawing\\n\\nNode-link diagrams are a widely used metaphor for creating visualizations of relational data. Most frequently, such techniques address creating 2D graph drawings, which are easy to use on computer screens and in print. In contrast, 3D node-link graph visualizations are far less used, as they have many known limitations and comparatively few well-understood advantages. A key issue here is that such 3D visualizations require users to select suitable viewpoints. We address this limitation by studying the ability of layout techniques to produce high-quality views of 3D graph drawings. For this, we perform a thorough experimental evaluation, comparing 3D graph drawings, rendered from a covering sampling of all viewpoints, with their 2D counterparts across various state-of-the-art node-link drawing algorithms, graph families, and quality metrics. Our results show that, depending on the graph family, 3D node-link diagrams can contain a many viewpoints that yield 2D visualizations that are of higher quality than those created by directly using 2D node-link diagrams. This not only sheds light on the potential of 3D node-link diagrams but also gives a simple approach to produce high-quality 2D node-link diagrams.',\n",

The changes in Antarctica are also substantially impacting global climate change. Therefore, detailed monitoring of snow evolution is key to understanding such changes. One way to conduct this monitoring is by installing trail cameras in a particular region and then processing the captured information. This option is affordable, but has some drawbacks, such as the fully automatic solution for the extraction of snow height from these images is not feasible. Therefore, it still requires human intervention, manually correcting the inaccurately extracted information. In this paper, we present Antarstick, a tool for visual guidance of the user to potentially wrong values extracted from poor-quality images and support for their interactive correction. This tool allows for much quicker and semi-automated processing of snow height from time-lapse photography.\",\n",
       " '10.1111/cgf.15099': '##AutoVizuA11y: A Tool to Automate Screen Reader Accessibility in Charts\\n\\nCharts remain widely inaccessible on the web for users of assistive technologies like screen readers. This is, in part, due to data visualization experts still lacking the experience, knowledge, and time to consistently implement accessible charts. As a result, screen reader users are prevented from accessing information and are forced to resort to tabular alternatives (if available), limiting the insights that they can gather. We worked with both groups to develop AutoVizuA11y, a tool that automates the addition of accessible features to web-based charts. It generates human-like descriptions of the data using a large language model, calculates statistical insights from the data, and provides keyboard navigation between multiple charts and underlying elements. Fifteen screen reader users interacted with charts made accessible with AutoVizuA11y in a usability test, thirteen of which praised the tool for its intuitive design, short learning curve, and rich information. On average, they took 66 seconds to complete each of the eight analytical tasks presented and achieved a success rate of 89%. Through a SUS questionnaire, the participants gave AutoVizuA11y an \"Excellent\" score — 83.5/100 points. We also gathered feedback from two data visualization experts who used the tool. They praised the tool availability, ease of use and functionalities, and provided feedback to add AutoVizuA11y support for other technologies in the future.'}"
