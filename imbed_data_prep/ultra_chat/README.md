# Ultra Chat

Data preparation for the UltraChat dataset.

## Data source

[UltraChat](https://huggingface.co/datasets/stingning/ultrachat) is an
open-source, large-scale, multi-round dialogue dataset powered by OpenAI's
Turbo APIs.

- **1.4 million dialogues** generated by ChatGPT
- **Wide range of topics** with carefully designed prompts
- **Two-API approach:** one ChatGPT instance plays the user, another
  generates responses
- **Privacy-conscious:** no direct use of Internet data as prompts

The dataset underwent post-processing and filtering for quality.  A curated
subset is also available at
[HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k).

## What it does

1. **Load from Hugging Face** -- download the dataset via the `datasets`
   library.

(Further processing can be added for embedding, projection, and clustering.)

## Output

Raw conversation data from the Hugging Face dataset.
